# Main coding conventions:

## Intro
Welcome vistor and/or future me! These are the conventions I was thinking of between this project and our team project that I wanted to act as more or less the standard we (past you and current you, confusing I know!) would use for most if hopefully all our code going forward!

## Code Grammar:
This will cover the majority of the grammar rules for our code

### Naming:
- Use PascalCase for `type` names and `enum` values
- Use camelCase for `function`, `method` and `property` names, along with `local variables`
- Use FULL_CAPS for `constants`

### Indentation:
Always use tabs, NO SPACE!

### Comments:
Use most applicable comment method related to code base such as -
- For `C` and `C++` use // for single line and /* */ for multi-line
- For `Java` and `JavaScript` use // for single line and /* */ for multi-line
- For `HTML` use <!- - <sub>remove spaces inbetween the dashes</sub> - -> for single line and the same for multi-line
- For `Python` use # for single line and """ """ for multi-line
- For `SQL` use -- for single line and /* */ for multi-line

## Additional space for future conventions (notes):
